name: Deploy Node.js backend to Azure App Service

# This workflow will build and deploy your Node.js application to Azure App Service
# every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch. It relies on the
# `azure/webapps-deploy` action. Before this workflow will work you must
# provision an Azure App Service (for example via the Azure Portal or CLI) and
# generate a publish profile from the portal. Store the publish profile XML
# contents as a repository secret named `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`.
